abstract: |
  Relational Quantum Mechanics (RQM), when supplemented by the principle of finite informational capacity (Finite Informationality), provides a natural and operational foundation for the hypothesis of Subjective Physics. This synthesis resolves key paradoxes of quantum observation by eliminating the need for infinite branching of states and hidden variables, while proposing a model in which the coherence of reality emerges through finite informational exchanges between systems (R-events). The present work directly develops ideas from our earlier study on cognitive phase transitions in Subjective Physics, now providing a formal framework that integrates RQM postulates, finite informational alignment, and ...operational mappings to Montinaâ€“Wolf type models.
