  "description": "This work develops the operational foundations of quantum theory within Relational Quantum Mechanics, introducing the principle of Finite Informational Capacity and R-events as fundamental units of interaction. The framework explains the emergence of classicality and addresses the Wignerâ€™s Friend paradox through Monte Carlo simulations and bootstrap inference, providing a reproducible model of the Quantum Measurement Problem grounded in subjective physics.",
